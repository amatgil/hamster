* Hamster


Replace your mouse with your keyboard!

Main concept was inspired by [[mouseless][https://mouseless.click]].

** Install
*** NixOS
#+begin_src bash
  direnv allow
  cargo build --release
#+end_src
*** Other
Install required dependencies (see =shell.nix=), then =make=.

** Usage
(The deamon is yet unimplemented and might get scratched for a more dynamic approach)

The core of =hamster= is the deamon (=hamsterwheel=): it waits for commands sent to it. Once it runs, commands can be sent via:
- =hamstersend overlay=: cover the screen in a grid for moving the mouse
- =hamstersend scrollup=: scroll up
- =hamstersend scrolldown=: scroll down
- =hamstersend click N=: click mouse button N (1 <= N <= 5)

*** The Overlay
- Press =Esc= to close it
- Press the two keys corresponding to the cell to move the mouse to its center.
- Press =Space= to click in the center of the cell, or continue to press the corresponding keys for greating accuracy.
