* Hamster


Replace your mouse with your keyboard!

Main concept was inspired by [[mouseless][https://mouseless.click]].

** Install
*** NixOS
#+begin_src bash
  direnv allow
  cargo build --release
#+end_src
*** Other
Install required dependencies (see =shell.nix=), then =make=.

** Usage
The core of =hamster= is the deamon (=hamsterwheel=): it waits for commands sent to it. Once it runs, commands can be sent via:
- =hamster overlay=: cover the screen in a grid for moving the mouse
- =hamster scrollup=: scroll up
- =hamster scrolldown=: scroll down
- =hamster click N=: click mouse button N (1 <= N <= 5)
